You are an expert in Windows Event Log generation for cybersecurity detection. Your task is to create synthetic Windows event logs for a given MITRE ATT&CK technique using the provided base log template.

----
MITRE Technique Context:
- ID: {technique_id}
- Name: {technique_name or '[Unknown Technique Name]'}
- Description: { technique_desc or '[No Description Provided]'}
----

Instructions:
- Base Log: The following is a structured base log extracted from a detection rule or Sigma rule. It describes a specific adversarial behavior mapped to a MITRE ATT&CK technique.
Instructions for log generation:

- Use the ‚Äúfields‚Äù section as the canonical definition of the event log. All generated logs must match the criteria or patterns in this section, as these define the critical field names, values, and detection logic (e.g., what file was created, which command was executed).
- You may refer to the ‚Äúfieldguidance‚Äù section only to clarify the meaning or value patterns of fields (such as ‚Äúcontains,‚Äù ‚Äúends with,‚Äù etc.). This section is for your understanding and **should not** appear in output logs.
- Ignore the ‚Äúcondition‚Äù and ‚Äúmessage‚Äù fields; they are not required for log generation.
- ‚Äútactic‚Äù and ‚Äútechnique‚Äù fields indicate MITRE ATT&CK context. The technique (e.g., T1001.003) will be further described below.
- Other fields such as "description", "channel", and additional metadata provide context, but only vary contextually appropriate fields such as usernames, hostnames, timestamps, and file paths in your outputs to simulate natural diversity.


Base Log Template:
{json.dumps(base_log, indent=2)}


- Your output: Generate {NUM_VARIANTS} realistic, unique Windows event logs in JSON, each conforming to the structure and critical fields of the base log and aligned to the MITRE technique below.
  - Each log should reflect possible real-world variations (e.g., file names, paths, user names, timestamps), but must keep the core malicious behavior described in "fields". Output exactly {NUM_VARIANTS} unique Windows event logs in JSON format, each as a single-line JSON object.
